# Vanier Master Schedule Api

This is a simple Python API wrapper for the Vanier master schedule. You can browse using your terminal or integrate it with something else (for example notify you if seats are available).

This was made to have *some* fun in a time when registration is not so great, to say the least, where schedules are *awful* with *no* available GenEd courses...

**TODO:**
- [ ] Docstrings and ReadMe documentation
- [ ] ReadMe examples
- [ ] Filtering support (from the master schedule)
- [ ] Searching support (from the master schedule)
- [ ] Sorting support (from the master schedule)
- [ ] Improve fetch handling

*This project is made a student and is by no means an official way to access the master schedule.*
